SQL Exercise 3 – Find the Error
What is wrong with this SQL query?

Code 1:
SELECT Id, name, YEAR(BillingDate) AS Year
FROM Records
WHERE Year >= 2010

Code 2:
SELECT id, name
FROM students
WHERE grades =
             (SELECT MAX(grades)
              FROM students
              GROUP BY subject_id;);

Answer:
Code 1: Used "Year" at Where clause instead of "YEAR(BillingDate)". And forgated ';'.
Code 2: We don't need Group by at Subquery. If we add this to select, then there will be multiple rows. Since it is equal we can delete this row.

Question 2-2
We’ll work with the beverages table. Its first rows are given below.

id	name	    launch_year	fruit_pct	contributed_by
1	Bruzz	    2007	     45	        Sam Malone
2	Delightful	2008	     41	        Sam Malone
3	Nice	    2015	     42	        Sam Malone
Write a query to extract only beverages where fruit_pct is between 35 and 40 (including both ends).

Answer:
Select id,name
from beverages
where fruit_pct>= 35 and fruit_pct<=40;

Question 2-3
We’ll work with the beverages table again. Its first rows are given below.

id	name	launch_year	fruit_pct	contributed_by
1	Bruzz	2007	45	Sam Malone
2	Delightful	2008	41	Sam Malone
3	Nice	2015	42	Sam Malone
Write a query to extract only beverages whose contributor only has one name

Write a query that finds the average fruit_pct by contributor and displays it ascending order.

Answer:
Select contributed_by, avg(fruit_pct) avg_fruit_pct
from beverages
group by 1
order by 2:

Question 2-5
Take a look at the query given below:

SELECT column, AGG_FUNC(column_or_expression), …
  FROM a_table
 INNER JOIN some_table
       ON a_table.column = some_table.column
 WHERE a_condition
 GROUP BY column
HAVING some_condition
 ORDER BY column
 LIMIT 5;
In what order does SQL run the clauses? Select the correct option from the list of choices below:

SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY
FROM, WHERE, HAVING, SELECT, LIMIT
SELECT, FROM, INNER JOIN, GROUP BY
FROM, SELECT, LIMIT, WHERE

Answer: FROM, WHERE, HAVING, SELECT, LIMIT
*From: Order of execution of a query starts with "From" statement. Because if we cannot access our table we cannot execute anything. 
*Joins: Join is for combining columns from one or more tables into a new table. Its logic is the same as the From statement. We have to firstly access tables.
*Where: If we filter our data firstly we can improve our query performance. Because of it, after accessing tables we filter them. 
*Group by: Group by is used for aggregating data by cohorts. 
*Having: Having is for filtering aggregated columns. If the query has a GROUP BY clause, then the constraints in the HAVING clause are then applied to the grouped rows 
*Select: Displays final columns. 
*Distinct: Of the remaining rows, rows with duplicate values in the column marked as DISTINCT will be discarded.
*Order by: It sorts our results.
*Limit: It limits our results. 


Question 3-1
We are given two tables, a users table with demographic information and the neighborhood they live in and a neighborhoods table. 
Write a query that returns all of the neighborhoods that have 0 users.

users table:

COLUMNS	              TYPE
id	              int
name	              varchar
neighborhood_id	int
created_at	      datetime

neighborhoods table:

COLUMNS	    TYPE
id	    int
name	    varchar
city_id	    int

Hint: Our aim to find all the neighborhoods without users. In a sense we need all the neighborhoods that do not have a singular user living in them. 
This means we have to introduce a concept of existence of a column in one table, but not in the other.

Answer: 
select id 
from (select n.id, count(u.id) as user_count
from neighborhoods as n 
left join users as u on n.id=u.neighborhood_id
group by 1
having user_count=0) t;

Question 3-2: Write a query to return pairs of projects where the end date of one project matches the start date of another project.

projects table:

COLUMN	    TYPE
id	        integer
title	    string
start_date	datetime
end_date	datetime
budget	    float

Output:

COLUMN	            TYPE
project_title_end	string
project_title_start	string
date	            datetime
Here, we are trying to use values in a single table to generate comparisons. Specifically, we are looking for pairs of projects such that one project starts on the same day that another project ends.

This will require us to perform a self-join.

Hint: Remember, when performing a self-join, the order of your values is very important. You will want to be particular about aliasing to make sure you keep your tables straight.

Answer: 
select t2.title as project_title_end, t1.title as project_title_start
from projects t1
inner join projects t2 ON t1.start_date = t2.end_date;

Question 3-3:You are given a table that represents search results from searches on Facebook. 
The query column is the search term, position column represents each position the search result came in, 
and the rating column represents the human rating of the search result from 1 to 5 where 5 is high relevance and 1 is low relevance.

1. Write a query to compute a metric to measure the quality of the search results for each query.

2. You want to be able to compute a metric that measures the precision of the ranking system based on position. For example, if the results for dog and cat are....

QUERY	RESULT_ID	POSITION	RATING	NOTES
dog	    1000	     1	         2	    picture of hotdog
dog	    998	         2	         4	    dog walking
dog	    342	         3	         1	    zebra
cat	    123	         1	         4	    picture of cat
cat	    435	         2	         2	    cat memes
cat	    545	         3	         1	    pizza shops
...we would rank 'cat' as having a better search result ranking precision than 'dog' based on the correct sorting by rating.

Write a query to create a metric that can validate and rank the queries by their search result precision. Round the metric (avg_rating column) to 2 decimal places.

search_results table:

COLUMN	    TYPE
query	    Varchar
result_id	integer
position	integer
rating	    integer
The ratings of each search result (1 to 5 where 5 is high relevance and 1 is low relevance) could be used to compute a metric that measures the quality of the search results for each query.

For example, if the search query for 'tiger' has 5s for each result, then that would average to be a perfect result. Therefore, taking the average of the ratings seems like a good way to measure the quality of the search results.

Answer: 
with a as (
select query, avg(position) avg_pos, avg(rating) avg_rat,
std(position) std_pos, std(rating) std_rat
from search_results group by 1)

select s.query,
sum((position -avg_pos)(rating - avg_rat))/
((count()-1)std_posstd_rat)
as avg_rating
from search_results s join a on s.query = a.query
GROUP BY 1;

Question 3-4: We are given a table called employers that consists of a user_id, year, and employer EIN label. 
Users can have multiple employers dictated by the different EIN labels.

Write a query to add a flag to each user if they have added a new employer in the last year in the table.

employers table:

COLUMN	TYPE
user_id	integer
year	string
employer_ein	string

Example:
employers table: 
# user_id    year    employer_ein
# 34323      2018    A
# 34323      2018    B
# 34323      2018    C
# 34323      2017    F
# 34323      2017    A
# 34323      2017    B
#
# 86323      2018    A
# 86323      2018    B
# 86323      2018    C
# 86323      2017    B
#
# 98787      2018    A
# 98787      2018    B
# 98787      2018    F
# 98787      2017    F
# 98787      2017    B
# 98787      2017    A
#
# 55559      2018    A
# 55559      2018    B
# 55559      2018    C

Output:
# user_id    year      new_ein_flag
# 34323      2018      1
# 86323      2018      1
# 98787      2018      0

Answer:
select user_id, year,
       max(case when min_year = max_year then 1 else 0 end) as new_ein_flag
from (select employer.*, max(year) over () as max_year,
             min(year) over (partition by user_id, employer_ein) as min_year
      from employer
     ) employer
where year = max_year
group by 1,2;

Question 3-5: Write a SQL query to select the 2nd highest salary in the engineering department. 
If more than one person shares the highest salary, the query should select the next highest salary.

employees
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| first_name    | varchar |
| last_name     | varchar |
| salary        | int     |
| department_id | int |--+
+---------------+---------+  |
|
departments                  |
+---------------+---------+  |
| id            | int     |<-+
| name          | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
Output:

COLUMN	TYPE
salary	int

First, we need the name of the department to be associated with each employee in the employees table, to understand which department each employee is a part of.

The “department_id” field in the employees table is associated with the “id” field in the departments table. 
We call the “department_id” a foreign key because it is a column that references the primary key of another table, which in this case is the “id” field in the departments table.

Based on this common field, we can join both tables, using INNER JOIN, to associate the name of the department name to the employees that are a part of those departments.

Answer:
With Ranking as(SELECT e.id,salary,
DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary desc) as ranking
FROM employees as e 
INNER JOIN departments as d ON e.department_id = d.id
where d.name='engineering')

select salary
from Ranking
where ranking = 2;

Question 3-6: Given the revenue transactions table above, write a query that finds the third purchase of every user.

`transactions` table:
COLUMN	TYPE
id	integer
user_id	integer
created_at	datetime
product_id	integer
quantity	integer

Output:
COLUMN	TYPE
user_id	integer
created_at	datetime
product_id	integer
quantity	integer
We need an indicator of which purchase was the third value. Whenever we think of ranking our dataset, it is helpful to then immediately think of a specific window function we can use.

We need to apply the RANK function to the transactions table. The RANK function is a window function that assigns a rank to each row in the partition of the result set.

Answer: 
With Ranking as(
	SELECT id,
	DENSE_RANK() OVER ([PARTITION by user_id] ORDER BY created_at asc) as ranking
	FROM transactions 
)

select user_id,created_at,product_id,quantity
from Ranking as r 
left join transactions as t on r.id=t.id
where ranking = 3;


Question 3-7: Given three tables, representing customer transactions and customer attributes: Write a query to get the average order value by gender.

transactions table:
COLUMN	TYPE
id	integer
user_id	integer
created_at	datetime
product_id	integer
quantity	integer

users table:
COLUMN	TYPE
id	integer
name	varchar
sex	varchar

products table:
COLUMN	TYPE
id	integer
name	string
price	float

Answer: 
Select sex, avg(quantity*price) as order_value
from transactions as t 
left join users as u on t.user_id=u.id
left join products as p on t.product_id=p.id
group by 1; 

Question 3-8: Given three tables: user_dimension, account_dimension, and download_facts, find the average number of downloads for free vs paying customers broken out by day.

Note: The account_dimension table maps users to multiple accounts where they could be a paying customer or not. Also, round average_downloads to 2 decimal places.

user_dimension table:
COLUMN	TYPE
user_id	int
account_id	int

account_dimension table:
COLUMN	TYPE
account_id	int
paying_customer	boolean

download_facts table:
COLUMN	TYPE
date	date
user_id	int
downloads	int

Output:
COLUMN	TYPE
date	date
paying_customer	boolean
average_downloads	float

Let is first break it down. What values in which tables can we join together to get the data that we need?

Ideally the data should be broken down such that we could easily graph the values to visualize two line plots of free vs paying users. 
The x-axis would represent the date and the y-axis would represent the average number of downloads.

The user_dimension table represents the mapping between account ids and user ids while the account_dimension table holds the value if the customer is paying or not. 
Lastly the download_facts table has the date and number of downloads per user.

Answer: 
select date, paying_customer, round(SUM(df.downloads)/COUNT(DISTINCT ud.user_id), 2) as average_downloads
from user_dimension  as ud
left join account_dimension as ad on ad.account_id=ud.account_id
left join download_facts   as df on df.user_id=ud.user_id
group by 1,2;

Question 3-10: Given a table of job postings, write a query to breakdown the number of users that have posted their jobs once versus the number of users that have posted at least one job multiple times.

job_postings table:

COLUMN	TYPE
id	integer
job_id	integer
user_id	integer
date_posted	datetime
This question is kind of complicated so it's helpful to break it into multiple steps. First let's visualize what the output would look like.

Output:

COLUMN	TYPE
posted_jobs_once	int
posted_at_least_one_job_multiple_times	int
We want the value of two different metrics, the number of users that have posted their jobs once versus the number of users that have posted at least one job multiple times. What does that mean exactly?

Well if a user has 5 jobs but only posted them once, then they are part of the first statement. But if they have a 5 jobs and posted a total of 7 times, that means that they had to at least posted one job multiple times.

To get to that point, we need a table with the count of user-job pairings and the number of times each job gets posted. We can pretty easily get to that point with just a simple GROUP BY on two variables, user_id and job_id.

Now we just need a way to differentiate the users that posted each job once from users that posted multiple times. Lets go back to our example. 
We can deduce that if we take the sum of the number of rows for each user and the sum of the number of times each job is posted, they must be equal for the user to have posted each job only once, since we grouped by the user and the job id.

Answer: 
with total_job as (
select user_id, date_posted, count(job_id) as total_job
from job_postings 
group by 1,2),

total_post as (
select user_id, date_posted, count(id) as total_post
from job_postings 
group by 1,2),

posted_jobs_once as (
select user_id
from total_job as tj 
inner join total_post as tp on tj.user_id=tp.user_id
where total_post <= total_job),

posted_at_least_one_job_multiple_times as (
select user_id
from total_job as tj 
inner join total_post as tp on tj.user_id=tp.user_id
where total_post > total_job)

select count(pjo.user_id) as posted_jobs_once, count(pjm.user_id) as posted_at_least_one_job_multiple_times
from posted_jobs_once as pjo  
inner join posted_at_least_one_job_multiple_times as pjm on pjo.user_id=pjm.user_id;
