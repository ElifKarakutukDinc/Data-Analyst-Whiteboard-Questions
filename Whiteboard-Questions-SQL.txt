SQL Exercise 3 â€“ Find the Error
What is wrong with this SQL query?

Code 1:
SELECT Id, name, YEAR(BillingDate) AS Year
FROM Records
WHERE Year >= 2010

Code 2:
SELECT id, name
FROM students
WHERE grades =
             (SELECT MAX(grades)
              FROM students
              GROUP BY subject_id;);

Answer:
Code 1: Used "Year" at Where clause instead of "YEAR(BillingDate)". And forgated ';'.
Code 2: We don't need Group by at Subquery. If we add this to select, then there will be multiple rows. Since it is equal we can delete this row.
